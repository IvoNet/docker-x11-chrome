# XQuartz

This part of the project makes the XQartz available for auto open by other applications (e.g. docker)

This should only have to be run if you see a message kinda like this:

```txt
(google-chrome:1): Gtk-WARNING **:  cannot open display: :0
```

# Usage

must be run as root

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

# Requirements

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) should be installed on your macbrew
